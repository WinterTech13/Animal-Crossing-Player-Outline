# Animal Crossing Player Outline
A short Python program that plays hourly Animal Crossing themes.

## Features:
- A player that plays the appropriate hourly theme based on your system time.
- The player randomly chooses between Sunny and Rainy variants.
- The player randomly chooses between Sunny and Snowy variants during the Winter "season".
- The player automatically changes the theme every hour.

## Usage:
0. This is a Python program for Windows only (for now at least)
1. Get Animal Crossing music files
   - Cannot provide these files due to copyright reasons
   - Keep files in the same directory
2. Name the variants (without brackets):
   - Sunny: `[Hour][am/pm].mp3`
   - Rainy/Snowy: `[Hour][am/pm] [Rainy/Snowy]`
3. Run the program
